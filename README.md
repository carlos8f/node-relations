relations
=========

entity relationship, role, and permissions API for Node.js

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/carlos8f/node-relations.png)](http://travis-ci.org/carlos8f/node-relations)

**relations** is a simple permissions API which uses a natural language approach.

Contexts
--------

First, you'll create a **context**, which contains a list of roles which map to
actions. Here we'll create a context called `repos`, to model Github repositories.

```js
var relations = require('relations');

relations.define('repos', {
  owner: ['pull', 'push', 'administrate'],
  collaborator: ['pull', 'push'],
  watcher: ['pull']
});
```

Defining the context makes available a method on `relations` that matches the
context name, in this case, `relations.repos()`. For permission checks, this is
the only method we'll need to call.

### Dynamic roles

To add or modify roles at runtime, you can also use the following methods:

```js
// add a role dynamically
relations.repos.addRole('scientist', ['test', 'hyphothesize']);
// update the actions for a role
relations.repos.updateRole('scientist', ['test', 'hypothesize', 'absquatulate']);
// remove a role
relations.repos.removeRole('scientist');
```

**Please note** that the role -> action map is defined exclusively in the code,
and not stored. If you run a cluster of servers, and choose to use dynamic roles,
you must call `addRole()` etc on ALL servers in the cluster (I suggest using
pub/sub).

Declarations
------------

Now, we need to tell our app who has those roles for which repos.

```js
relations.repos('Carlos is the owner of buffet.');
```

This assigns the role `owner` to the subject `Carlos` for the object `buffet`.

### Token replacements

Note that the API has multiple syntaxes, and this is functionally equivalent:

```js
relations.repos(':user is owner of :repo', {user: 'Carlos', repo: 'buffet'});
```

As is this:

```js
relations.repos('%s is an owner of %s', 'Carlos', 'buffet');
```

To assign a role which should apply to all objects, simply leave the object out
of the sentence:

```js
relations.repos('%s is a watcher.', 'Brian');
```

**Note: Using token replacements is recommended, to prevent injection attacks!**

### Syntax

The syntax for a **declaration** consists of:

```
<subject> is [ a / an / the ] <role> [ [ of / to / from / in / with ] <object> ] [.]
```

Verb question
-------------

To ask if a user can perform an action:

```js
relations.repos('Can %s pull?', 'Brian', function (err, can) {
  // can = true (based on "watcher" role)
});
```

We can also check if an action can be performed on a specific object:

```js
relations.repos('Can %s push to buffet?', 'Brian', function (err, can) {
  // can = false (Brian doesn't have "owner" or "collaborator" roles)
});
```

### Syntax

The syntax for an **verb question** consists of:

```
( Can | can ) <subject> <verb> [ [ of / to / from / in / with ] <object> ] [?]
```

Role question
-------------

To check if a user has a role:

```js
relations.repos('Is %s a collaborator of %s?', 'Brian', 'buffet', function (err, is) {
  // is = false
});
```

We can also leave the object out to check for a global role:

```js
relations.repos('Is %s a %s?', 'Brian', 'watcher', function (err, is) {
  // is = true
});
```

### Syntax

The syntax for a **role question** consists of:

```
( Is | is ) <subject> [ a / an / the ] <role> [ [ of / to / from / in / with ] <object> ] [?]
```

Verb request
------------

In addition to true/false checks, **relations** can return an array of objects
which match certain criteria. For example:

```js
relations.repos('What can %s pull from?', 'Carlos', function (err, repos) {
  // repos = ['buffet']
});
```

### Syntax

The syntax for a **verb request** consists of:

```
( What | what ) can <subject> <verb> [ of / to / from / in / with ] [?]
```

Role request
------------

Also, we can ask for an array of objects a user has a role for:

```js
relations.repos('What is %s the owner of?', 'Carlos', function (err, repos) {
  // repos = ['buffet']
});
```

### Syntax

The syntax for a **role request** consists of:

```
( What | what ) is <subject> [ a / an / the ] <role> [ of / to / from / in / with ] [?]
```

Verb subject request
--------------------

To request an array of subjects who can perform an action on an object:

```js
relations.repos('Who can pull from %s?', 'buffet', function (err, users) {
  // users = ['Carlos']
});
```

### Syntax

```
( Who | who ) can <verb> [ of / to / from / in / with ] <object> [?]
```

Role subject request
--------------------

To request an array of subjects who have a role for an object:

```js
relations.repos('Who is the owner of %s?', 'buffet', function (err, users) {
  // users = ['Carlos']
});
```

### Syntax

```
( Who | who ) is [ a / an / the ] <role> [ of / to / from / in / with ] <object> [?]
```

Object verb request
-------------------

To request an array of verbs a subject can perform on an object:

```js
relations.repos('What actions can %s do with %s?', 'Carlos', 'buffet', function (err, verbs) {
  // verbs = ['pull', 'push', 'administrate']
});
```

### Syntax

```
What actions can <subject> do [ of / to / from / in / with ] <object> [?]
```

Object-Role map request
-----------------------

To get a map of object->role pairs for a subject:

```js
relations.repos('Describe what %s can do', 'Carlos', function (err, map) {
  // map = { '': [ 'watcher' ],
             'buffet': [ 'owner' ] }
});
```

### Syntax

```
[ Describe / detail / explain / get ] what <subject> can do [.]
```

Subject-Role map request
-----------------------

To get a map of subject->role pairs, optionally pertaining to an object:

```js
relations.repos('Get who can act', function (err, map) {
  // map = { 'carlos': [ 'watcher' ],
             'brian': [ 'watcher' ] }
});
```

```js
relations.repos('Explain who can act on %s', 'buffet', function (err, map) {
  // map = { 'carlos': [ 'owner' ] }
});
```

### Syntax

```
[ Describe / detail / explain / get ] who can act [ on <object> ] [.]
```

Revocation
----------

To revoke a role:

```js
relations.repos('%s is not the owner of %s', 'Carlos', 'buffet');
```

### Syntax

```
<subject> ( is not | isn't ) [ a / an / the ] <role> [ [ of / to / from / in / with ] <object> ] [.]
```

Pluggable data store
--------------------

**relations** uses a memory store out-of-the-box, which only works with a single
node processes and has no persistence. Two data stores are also provided 
however: Redis and MySQL.

### Redis store

To use the redis store, your app must make a
[node_redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) client and pass it like so:

```js
var relations = require('relations')
  , redis = require('redis')

relations.use(relations.stores.redis, {client: redis.createClient()});
```

### MySQL store

To use the MySQL store, your app must make a
[node-mysql](https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql) client and pass it like so:

```js
var relations = require('relations')
  , mysql = require('mysql')

relations.use(relations.stores.mysql, {client: mysql.createConnection({user: 'root', database: 'test'})});
```

### Make your own store

A **relations** store is simply a node module that exports an event emitter
and responds to the following events:

#### `init` (options, cb)

Initialize the store with `options` (from `relations.use()`) and call `cb(err)`
when done.

#### `declaration` (cmd, cb)

Respond to a declaration and call `cb()` when done. `cmd` will be an object
containing the properties:

- ctx - context object
- subject
- role
- object (optional)

#### `revocation` (cmd, cb)

Respond to a revocation and call `cb()` when done. `cmd` will be an object
containing the properties:

- ctx - context object
- subject
- role
- object (optional)

### `verb-question` (cmd, cb)

Respond to a verb question and call `cb(err, /* boolean */ can)` with the result.
`cmd` will be an object containing the properties:

- ctx - context object
- subject
- verb
- object (optional)

### `role-question` (cmd, cb)

Respond to a role question and call `cb(err, /* boolean */ is)` with the result.
`cmd` will be an object containing the properties:

- ctx - context object

- role
- object (optional)

### `verb-request` (cmd, cb)

Respond to a verb request and call `cb(err, /* array */ objects)` with the result.
`cmd` will be an object containing the properties:

- ctx - context object
- subject
- verb

### `role-request` (cmd, cb)

Respond to a role request and call `cb(err, /* array */ objects)` with the result.
`cmd` will be an object containing the properties:

- ctx - context object
- subject
- role

### `verb-subject-request` (cmd, cb)

Respond to a verb subject request and call `cb(err, /* array */ subjects)` with
the result. `cmd` will be an object containing the properties:

- ctx - context object
- verb
- object

### `role-subject-request` (cmd, cb)

Respond to a role subject request and call `cb(err, /* array */ subjects)` with
the result. `cmd` will be an object containing the properties:

- ctx - context object
- role
- object

### `object-verb-request` (cmd, cb)

Respond to an object verb request and call `cb(err, /* array */ verbs)` with
the result. `cmd` will be an object containing the properties:

- ctx - context object
- object
- subject

### `object-role-map-request` (cmd, cb)

Respond to an object-role map request and call `cb(err, /* object */ map)` with
the result. `cmd` will be an object containing the properties:

- ctx - context object
- subject

### `subject-role-map-request` (cmd, cb)

Respond to a subject-role map request and call `cb(err, /* object */ map)` with
the result. `cmd` will be an object containing the properties:
